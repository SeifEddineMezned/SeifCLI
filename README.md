# SeifCLI

**SeifCLI is your smart terminal assistant â€” powered by local LLMs, styled with Rich, and able to control your browser and execute tasks like a personal hacker butler, with no API keys needed.**

SeifCLI is a proof-of-concept AI-powered command-line assistant that understands natural language and automates web-based tasks. It uses local Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret your commands, Selenium to control a web browser, and Rich to provide beautiful, interactive terminal output.

-   **Browser Automation**: Can open, navigate, and interact with websites to perform tasks.
-   **Rich Terminal UI**: Beautiful and informative output with progress indicators, formatted text, and more.
-   **Interactive Chat Mode**: A conversational interface with memory and history management.
-   **Extensible Skills System**: A modular plugin system that allows for new capabilities to be added easily.
-   **Web Scraping**: Extract text and links from web pages with built-in skills.
-   **File Operations**: Save and load text and JSON data with dedicated skills.
-   **Configuration System**: Customize SeifCLI's behavior through a flexible configuration system.
